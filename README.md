#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
> systematic operationof engineering principles, methods and, tools to make and maintain a high-quality software system/s

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
> 1 : the development of programming languages
> 2 : the establishment of software engineering as a field in the 1960s
> 3 : the advent of structured programming in the 1970s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
> Requirements: gathering user needs and systems requirements
> Design: making high-quality and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
> Implementation: writing the actual code and building software according to the design.
> Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
> Deployment: releasing the software to users and/or customers
> Maintenance: making updates, support and enhancements for the software after deployments.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
> Waterfall and Agile methodologies differ significantly in their approach to project management.  Waterfall is suitable for projects with stable requirements and strict documentation requirements, such as banking software, medical devices, and government regulations. It follows a linear and sequential process with clearly defined phases, such as requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. In contrast, Agile is iterative and incremental, prioritizing flexibility, customer collaboration, and continuous delivery of working software.  Agile teams work in short development cycles (sprints), which make it ideal for dynamic industries like software startups, mobile app development, and e-commerce platforms because it allows for frequent feedback and adaptation. Agile encourages cross-functional teamwork, minimal documentation, and early risk mitigation through continuous testing, whereas Waterfall places an emphasis on extensive documentation and late-stage risk management. Ultimately, Waterfall suits projects requiring predictability and rigid structure, whereas Agile thrives in environments demanding adaptability and rapid innovation.

> Scenarios where Waterfall Methodologies would be appropriate are: Government Projects and Banking Software Developments
> Scenarios where Agile methodologies would be appropriate are: Game Development and E-commerce platforms

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
> Quality Assurance Engineer:  ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
> Project manager: oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
> Software Developer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
> So Version Control Systems or (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members, examples of VCS is Git and Github
> So Intergrated Development Enviroments or (IDE's in short) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testind code example of IDE's are Visual Studio

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
> Changing Requirements: during the development cycle, requirements may change, causing scope creep and project delays.
> Tight Deadlines: the pressure to deliver software products on time can cause development to be rushed and lower quality.
> Technical Debt: technical debt, which is accumulated through poor solutions or shortcuts, can stymie future development efforts and raise maintenance costs.
> Strategies to mitigate those challenges: effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
> Intergration testing: test interactions between different components or subsystems
> Unit testing: test individual components or modules of software
> System testing: test the entire software system as one unit or as a whole.
> Acceptance testing: test against user requirements to make sure if the software meets the user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
> Definition: Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, ensuring accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses.  It involves structuring queries in a way that maximizes the model’s understanding and output efficiency.
> Importance the ability of prompt engineering to optimize AI interactions, improve accuracy, reduce ambiguity, and enhance problem-solving abilities is what makes it so important. Prompts that have been carefully crafted can help AI produce precise responses, automate tasks effectively, and support a wide range of applications like content generation, coding assistance, and decision-making. As AI continues to evolve, mastering prompt engineering becomes crucial for leveraging AI’s full potential across industries.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
> Vague prompt: Give me an image of a dog.
> Detailed prompt: Provide an animated picture of a black dog to put in a children book/story.

 > Explaination: By being more specific you minimize the changes of the AI model to give you the incorrect image thus means you're saving yourself time and resources.
